    /*Feature	            Inheritance	                        Polymorphism
    Definition	            One class inherits another	        Same method behaves differently
    Purpose	                Code reuse	                        Flexibility in behavior
    Example	                class Car extends Vehicle	        Animal a = new Dog(); a.sound();
    Type	                Is a relationship (child-parent)	Is a behavior (many forms)
    Dependency	            Requires base and derived classes	Depends on inheritance or interfaces*/
